Oh my GOD what is this?
=======================

![Aaron Seigo is watching you code](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pvaret/keyes/master/screenshots/screenshot1.png)

The most important productivity app you didn't know you were missing.

It allows the KDE e.v. board from 2007-2008 to watch you work and silently
judge you. See if Aaron Seigo's slight frown doesn't guilt you into coding a
million times better.

That sounds awesome. How do I run it?
=====================================

Install Python (2 or 3, no matter). Install PyQt5. Run `KEyes.py`. That's it.


Boring stuff
============

Pictures are from the KDE e.v. web site and some sort of copyright certainly
applies. KEyes.py is licensed under the GPLv2 so if someone wants to make it
*even better somehow*, they can.
